# Running multiple agents

<Note>This guide is applicable to Dagster Cloud.</Note>

Each Dagster Cloud full deployment (e.g., `prod`) needs to have at least one agent running. A single agent is adequate for many use cases, but you may want to run multiple agents to provide redundancy if a single agent goes down.

It's recommended to only use multiple agents of the same type (e.g. multiple Kubernetes agents). Submitting runs to a specific agent isn't currently supported.

## Multiple agents in the same environment

If you want to run multiple agents in the same environment (e.g., multiple Kubernetes agents in the same namespace), you can set the number of replicas in the configuration for your particular agent type:

### In Docker

In Docker, you can set the number of replicas for a service in the `docker-compose.yaml` file if the deployment mode is set to `replicated` (which is the default):

```yaml
services:
  dagster-cloud-agent:
    ...
    deploy:
      mode: replicated
      replicas: 2
```

### In Kubernetes

In Kubernetes, the number of replicas is set in the Helm chart. You can set the number of replicas in the Helm command:

```shell
helm upgrade \
    ...
    --set replicas=2
```

or if using a `values.yaml` file:

```yaml
dagsterCloudAgent:
  ...
  replicas: 2
```

### In Amazon ECS

In Amazon ECS, the number of replicas can be set via the CloudFormation template:

```yaml
DagsterCloudAgent:
  Type: AWS::ECS::Service
  Properties:
    ...
    DesiredCount: 2
```

If using the CloudFormation template provided by Dagster, the number of replicas can be set via the `NumReplicas` parameter in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) UI.

## Multiple agents in different environments

If you want to run multiple agents in an environment where each agent can not access the others' resources (for example, multiple kubernetes namespaces or different clusters), you need to enable the `isolated_agents` option. This is supported for all agent types.

<Note>
  It is not currently possible to control which agent a request goes to.
</Note>

### In Docker

Add the following to the `dagster.yaml` file:

```yaml
isolated_agents:
  enabled: true

dagster_cloud_api:
  # <your other config>
  agent_label: "My agent" # optional
```

### In Kubernetes

Add the following options to your Helm command:

```shell
helm upgrade \
    ...
    --set agentReplicas.enabled=true \
    --set dagsterCloud.agentLabel="My agent" # optional, only supported on 0.13.14 and later
```

Or if you're using a `values.yaml` file:

```yaml
isolatedAgents:
  enabled: true

dagsterCloud:
  agentLabel: "My agent" # optional, only supported on 0.13.14 and later
```

### In Amazon ECS

The `isolated_agents` option can be set as per-deployment configuration on the `dagster.yaml` file used by your agent. See the [ECS configuration reference](/dagster-cloud/deployment/agents/amazon-ecs/configuration-reference#per-deployment-configuration) guide for more information.
