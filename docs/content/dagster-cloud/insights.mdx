# Dagster Cloud Insights

<Note>
  This feature is considered <strong>experimental</strong>.
</Note>

Using Dagster Cloud Insights, you can gain visibility into historical usage and cost metrics such as Dagster Cloud run duration, credit usage, and failures. You can also [integrate other external metrics](#integrating-external-metrics) into the Insights UI and [export metrics from Dagster Cloud](#exporting-metrics).

---

## About Insights

Launched in October 2023, Insights is currently an **experimental feature.** This means weâ€™re still collecting feedback on how Insights works and could make changes based on that feedback.

**Note**: These changes may include breaking changes to some aspects of the feature, though we will attempt to avoid it.

### Getting access

Currently, Insights can only be enabled by the Dagster team. To request access, you can:

- Reach out to us directly in your company's Slack channel
- Request access in the Dagster Slack <a href="https://dagster.slack.com/archives/C05V7GETFSQ" target="blank">#dagster-insights</a> channel

**Note**: While visualizing and exploring [Dagster-generated metrics](#available-metrics) within the UI will be available to all cloud users, [integrating external metrics](#integrating-external-metrics) into Insights is an **Enterprise-only feature**.

### Future plans

As part of the experimental release, out-of-the-box utilities for capturing external metadata are limited to dbt + Snowflake pipelines that create [Software-defined Assets](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets). Refer to the [Integrating Snowflake + dbt into Insights guide](/dagster-cloud/insights/integrating-snowflake-and-dbt) for more info.

Additional data sources and capabilities for capturing arbitrary metadata, as well as native tooling for enabling these capabilities on pipelines using ops and jobs, will be released in the coming weeks.

## Accessing Insights in the Dagster UI

To access this feature, click **Insights** in the top navigation bar in the UI:

<!-- ![Viewing the Insights tab in the Dagster UI](/images/dagster-cloud/insights/insights-tab.png) -->

/>

The left navigation panel on this page contains a list of [available metrics](#available-metrics). For each metric, the daily, weekly, or monthly aggregated values are displayed in the graph.

These metrics are updated on a daily basis.
