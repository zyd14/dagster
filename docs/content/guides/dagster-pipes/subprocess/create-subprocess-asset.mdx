# Using Dagster Pipes, part 1: Define a Dagster asset that invokes a subprocess

<Note>

This is part one of the [Using Dagster Pipes](/guides/dagster-pipes/subprocess) tutorial. If you are looking for how to modify your existing code that is already being orchestrated by Dagster, you can jump to <a href="/guides/dagster-pipes/subprocess/modify-external-code">Part 2: Modify external code</a>.

</Note>

In this part of the tutorial, you'll create a Dagster asset that, in its execution function, opens a Dagster pipes session and invokes a subprocess that executes some external code.

---

## Step 1: Define the Dagster asset

Before getting started, make sure you have fulfilled all the [prerequisites](/guides/dagster-pipes/subprocess#prerequisites) for the tutorial. You should have a standalone Python script named `external_code.py` which looks like the following:

```python file=/guides/dagster/dagster_pipes/subprocess/part_1/external_code.py lines=2-
import pandas as pd


def main():
    orders_df = pd.DataFrame({"order_id": [1, 2], "item_id": [432, 878]})
    total_orders = len(orders_df)
    print(f"processing total {total_orders} orders")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Step 1.1: Define the asset

First, create a new file named `dagster_code.py` in the same directory as the `external_code.py` file you created earlier in the [Prerequisites](/guides/dagster-pipes/subprocess#prerequisites) step.

Next, you’ll define the asset. Copy and paste the following into the file:

```python file=/guides/dagster/dagster_pipes/subprocess/part_1/dagster_code.py startafter=start_asset_marker endbefore=end_asset_marker lines=-16
import shutil

from dagster import (
    AssetExecutionContext,
    MaterializeResult,
    PipesSubprocessClient,
    asset,
    file_relative_path,
)


@asset
def subprocess_asset(
    context: AssetExecutionContext, pipes_subprocess_client: PipesSubprocessClient
) -> MaterializeResult:
    cmd = [shutil.which("python"), file_relative_path(__file__, "external_code.py")]
```

Here’s what we did in this example:

- Created an asset named `subprocess_asset`
- Provided <PyObject object="AssetExecutionContext" /> as the `context` argument to the asset. This object provides system information such as resources, config, and logging. We’ll come back to this a bit later in this section.
- Specified a resource for the asset to use, `PipesSubprocessClient`. We’ll also come back to this in a little bit.
- Declared a command list `cmd` to run the external script. In the list:
  - First, found the path to the Python executable on the system using `shutil.which("python")`.
  - Then, provided the file path to the file that we want to execute. In this case, it’s the `external_code.py` file that you created earlier.

### Step 1.2: Invoke the external code from the asset

Then, invoke a subprocess that executes the external code from the asset using the `pipes_subprocess_client` resource:

```python file=/guides/dagster/dagster_pipes/subprocess/part_1/dagster_code.py startafter=start_asset_marker endbefore=end_asset_marker
import shutil

from dagster import (
    AssetExecutionContext,
    MaterializeResult,
    PipesSubprocessClient,
    asset,
    file_relative_path,
)


@asset
def subprocess_asset(
    context: AssetExecutionContext, pipes_subprocess_client: PipesSubprocessClient
) -> MaterializeResult:
    cmd = [shutil.which("python"), file_relative_path(__file__, "external_code.py")]
    return pipes_subprocess_client.run(
        command=cmd, context=context
    ).get_materialize_result()
```

Let’s take a look at what this code does:

- The `PipesSubprocessClient` resource used by the asset exposes a `run` method.
- When the asset is executed, this method will synchronously execute the subprocess in in a pipes session, and it will return a `PipesClientCompletedInvocation` object.
- This object contains a `get_materialize_result` method, which you can use to access the <PyObject object="MaterializeResult" /> event reported by the subprocess. We'll talk about how to report events from the subprocess in the next section.
- Lastly, return the result of the subprocess.

---

## Step 2: Define a Definitions object

To make the asset and subprocess resource loadable and accessible by Dagster's tools, such as the CLI, UI, and Dagster Cloud, you’ll create a <PyObject object="Definitions" /> object that contains them.

Copy and paste the following to the bottom of `dagster_code.py`:

```python file=/guides/dagster/dagster_pipes/subprocess/part_1/dagster_code.py startafter=start_definitions_marker endbefore=end_definitions_marker
from dagster import Definitions

defs = Definitions(
    assets=[subprocess_asset],
    resources={"pipes_subprocess_client": PipesSubprocessClient()},
)
```

At this point, `dagster_code.py` should look like the following:

```python file=/guides/dagster/dagster_pipes/subprocess/part_1/dagster_code_finished.py
import shutil

from dagster import (
    AssetExecutionContext,
    Definitions,
    MaterializeResult,
    PipesSubprocessClient,
    asset,
    file_relative_path,
)


@asset
def subprocess_asset(
    context: AssetExecutionContext, pipes_subprocess_client: PipesSubprocessClient
) -> MaterializeResult:
    cmd = [shutil.which("python"), file_relative_path(__file__, "external_code.py")]
    return pipes_subprocess_client.run(
        command=cmd, context=context
    ).get_materialize_result()


defs = Definitions(
    assets=[subprocess_asset],
    resources={"pipes_subprocess_client": PipesSubprocessClient()},
)
```

---

## Step 3: Run the subprocess from the Dagster UI

In this step, you’ll execute the subprocess asset you created in earlier steps from the Dagster UI.

1. In a new command line session, run the following to start the UI:

   ```bash
   dagster dev -f dagster_code.py
   ```

2. Navigate to <http://localhost:3000>, where you should see the UI:

   <Image
   alt="Asset in the UI"
   src="/images/guides/dagster-pipes/subprocess/part-1-step-3-2-asset.png"
   width={1264}
   height={714}
   />

3. Click **Materialize** located in the top right to run your code:

   <Image
   alt="Materialize asset"
   src="/images/guides/dagster-pipes/subprocess/part-1-step-3-3-materialize.png"
   width={1326}
   height={744}
   />

4. Navigate to the [Run details](/concepts/webserver/ui#run-details) page, where you should see the logs for the run:

   <Image
   alt="Logs in the run details page"
   src="/images/guides/dagster-pipes/subprocess/part-1-step-3-4-logs.png"
   width={1272}
   height={718}
   />

5. In `external_code.py`, we have a `print` statement that outputs to `stdout`. Dagster will display these in the UI's raw compute log view. To see the `stdout` log, toggle the log section to **stdout**:

   <Image
   alt="Raw compute logs in the run details page"
   src="/images/guides/dagster-pipes/subprocess/part-1-step-3-5-stdout.png"
   width={1272}
   height={718}
   />

## What's next?

At this point, you've created a Dagster asset that invokes an external Python script, launched the code in a subprocess, and viewed the result in Dagster UI. Next, you'll learn how to [modify your external code to work with Dagster Pipes](/guides/dagster-pipes/subprocess/modify-external-code) to send information back to Dagster.
