</Note>

Dagster orchestrates dbt alongside other technologies, so you can schedule dbt with Spark, Python, etc. in a single data pipeline.

Dagster's [Software-defined Asset](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets) approach allows Dagster to understand dbt at the level of individual dbt models. This means that you can:

- Use Dagster's UI or APIs to run subsets of your dbt models, seeds, and snapshots.
- Track failures, logs, and run history for individual dbt models, seeds, and snapshots.
- Define dependencies between individual dbt models and other data assets. For example, put dbt models after the Fivetran-ingested table that they read from, or put a machine learning after the dbt models that it's trained from.

An asset graph like this:

<!-- ![Dagster graph with dbt, Fivetran, and TensorFlow](/images/integrations/dbt/dagster-dbt-fivetran-tensorflow.png) -->

alt="Dagster graph with dbt, Fivetran, and TensorFlow"
src="/images/integrations/dbt/dagster-dbt-fivetran-tensorflow.png"
width={1834}
height={1220}
/>

Can be produced from code like this:

```python file=/integrations/dbt/potemkin_dag_for_cover_image.py startafter=start endbefore=end
from pathlib import Path

from dagster_dbt import DbtCliResource, dbt_assets, get_asset_key_for_model
from dagster_fivetran import build_fivetran_assets

from dagster import AssetExecutionContext, asset

fivetran_assets = build_fivetran_assets(
    connector_id="postgres",
    destination_tables=["users", "orders"],
)


@dbt_assets(manifest=Path("manifest.json"))
def dbt_project_assets(context: AssetExecutionContext, dbt: DbtCliResource):
    yield from dbt.cli(["build"], context=context).stream()


@asset(
    compute_kind="tensorflow",
    deps=[get_asset_key_for_model([dbt_project_assets], "daily_order_summary")],
)
def predicted_orders():
    ...
```

## Getting started

There are a few ways to get started with Dagster and dbt:

- Take the [tutorial](/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster). We'll walk you through setting up dbt and Dagster together on your computer, using dbt's example [jaffle shop project](https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle_shop), the [dagster-dbt library](/\_apidocs/libraries/dagster-dbt), and a data warehouse, such as [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/). By the end, you'll have a working dbt and Dagster project and a handful of materialized Dagster assets, including a chart powered by data from your dbt models.
- Play around with a [working dbt + Dagster project](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/tree/master/examples/assets_dbt_python).
- Browse the [dagster-dbt integration reference](/integrations/dbt/reference) for short lessons on Dagster + dbt topics.
- Review the [API docs](/\_apidocs/libraries/dagster-dbt) for the dagster-dbt library.
- Automatically load your dbt models as Dagster assets by [importing an existing dbt project into Dagster Cloud](https://dagster.cloud/signup?next=/prod/getting-started%3Ftab%3Dimport_dbt_core_project%26serverless%3D1).
